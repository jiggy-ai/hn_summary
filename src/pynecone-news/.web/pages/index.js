The goal is to not charge individual developers. We make money by charging a license fee for some future enterprise features as well as providing a hosted version and support.<p>In the coming weeks, we plan to add features like key rotation, access logs + more integrations.

Pine Tar Poker is a yahtzee-inspired poker game with just a touch of cosmic horror for iOS and Android.<p>I started working on this idea last January by making a paper prototype: a simple printed score sheet I could use with a real deck of cards. I had some fun with that, so I brought it into Unity and kept expanding on it over the last 11 months during nights and weekends. It&#x27;s tough for me to stay motivated on side projects and see them through to release, but the act of shipping something is so fulfilling that it&#x27;s usually worth the pain. For Pine Tar, I stretched myself in the narrative department by adding a bit of a Lovecraftian tone to what would otherwise be a Western saloon setting.<p>One thing that kept me motivated during development was seeing my dad get hooked on the card game. He&#x27;d text me when he got his first royal flush and when he prestiged the score sheet -- he got every hand type in one game! He has amassed so much in-game cash, I think I need to expand the number of digits I show there!<p>If you get a chance to try it, let me know what you think!
